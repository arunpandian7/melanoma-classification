# Melanoma Classification
Melanoma Skin Cancer diagnosis using *Image Classification* of skin images using Deep Learning and Image Processing. This repository uses Deep Learning CNN Model built on PyTorch and trained over Google Cloud TPU.

> ### ‚ùó Progress Info
> Currently working on optimizing the results for Competition Submission. Will update the final version soon. Stay TunedüòÄ .

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About Melanoma
While skin cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer, Melanoma, specifically, is responsible for over 75% of skin cancer deaths, despite being least common skin cancer. Dermatologist currently have to diagnose the patients by evaluating patients every mole to find the melanoma skin lesions.
> Dermatologists can accurately diagnose Melanoma with the help of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. AI can offer a higher amounts of accuracy and provides an extra validation for human-based diagnosis. 

##  üìä Dataset
- Melanoma Classification is done using the data provided by the joint effort of Society for **Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM)** and **International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)** in their [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification/overview).
- Melanoma Classification Dataset - Preprocessed with external Dataset by [Roman](https://www.kaggle.com/nroman/melanoma-external-malignant-256)
